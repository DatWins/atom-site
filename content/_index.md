Welcome to Illion's atomic site!

This site is dedicated to atomic chess, a chess variant where captures lead to explosions.

The blog articles may be interesting and hopefully informative, while the Resources page is full of links to my lichess studies, which cover topics ranging from endgames to annotated games that you won't find elsewhere.
