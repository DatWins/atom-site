Welcome to Illion's atomic site!

The blog articles may be interesting and hopefully informative, while the Resources page is full of links to my lichess studies, which cover topics ranging from endgames to annotated games that you won't find elsewhere.

With thanks to GitHub, Hugo, Netlify, and those physics profs who taught me how to deal with Git!
