# Ars Atomica #

## ~~ Illion's atomic site ~~ ##

Beginning to port the [original blog](https://lichess.org/forum/team-illions-atomic-blog) from lichess forums (not the best content management/blogging platform in the world I must say) to some bare-bones thing I'm trying to grab control of.

With thanks to GitHub, Hugo, Netlify, Hugo XMin, and those physics profs who taught me how to deal with Git!
