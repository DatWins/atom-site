# Ars Atomica #

## ~~ Illion's atomic site ~~ ##

Beginning to port the [original blog](https://lichess.org/forum/team-illions-atomic-blog) from lichess forums (not the best content management/blogging platform in the world I must say) to some bare-bones thing I'm trying to grab control of.

This should be `inline code` that I can repurpose for chess notation. Like `1. e4 e5 2. Sf3 Sc6 3. Bb5` is the Spanish.

```
Or even some pure "code" goodness.
1. Nf3 f6 2. e3 e6 3. Bd3 g6 4. b4 Nc6 5. Bb2 Nd4 6. Ne5 d5 7. Nf7 Qd6 8. Bb5+ c6 9. Bxd4 Qb8!
WARNING: TRIPLE BACKTICK USES <pre></pre> AND BREAKS WRAP
```
Therefore TODO:

- Host FigurineSymbol T1
- Put all chess moves between backticks
- css the \<code\> tag to use FS T1
- Profit (can use regex to grep all moves between backticks, etc.)


With thanks to GitHub, Hugo, Netlify, Hugo XMin, and those physics profs who taught me how to deal with Git!
