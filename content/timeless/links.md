Here is a set of links to good sites:

## Where to play? ##
[lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) - Completely free and open-source, and with good diagram, study and analysis tools.


## Where can I learn? ##
[Chess Variants Training](https://chessvariants.training/) - A site written by [ProgramFOX](https://lichess.org/@/ProgramFOX) for variant tactics puzzles and variant960 games (randomised starting positions). The atomic problems are generally of very high quality, especially those by [Caustic](https://lichess.org/@/Caustic).

[tipau's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/tipau/featured) - A YouTube channel by the 2016 world champion and one of the all-time strongest atomic players, tipau has covered endgames and certain openings in great detail in his videos.

[ProgramFOX's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmx82Kgy9ALzAcmti0LwkJw/featured) - The creator of the Chess Variants Training site (see above) also from time to time streams and uploads videos of playing high-level atomic chess.
