{{< standalone-notation >}}1. e3 e6 2. Qf3 f5 3. Qh5+ g6 4. Qh4{{< /standalone-notation >}}

White goes for what some might call an unambitious opening. It doesn't press white's starting move advantage, simply leading to a situation where both sides can play a game of atomic chess. This tends to favour the player with better overall understanding.

{{< standalone-notation >}}4...Qxh4 5. Nf3 e5{{< /standalone-notation >}}

Black cannot defend both e5 and g5, but white's knight is not too dangerous and black can play around it. With the text move black prevents Ne5 and by extension Nd7 ideas. Other choices include 5...Nf6, 5...Nc6 and 5...Bg7.

{{< standalone-notation >}}6. Ng5 Nf6 7. f3{{< /standalone-notation >}}

The most logical move. Black was threatening ...Ne4, so 7. Ne6?? Bb4 8. Nc3 Ne4 is mating. Playable instead might be 7. Nc3 Bb4 (7...Ng4 8. f3 Bb4 transposes) 8. f3 Ng4 9. Nxh7 Nxh2 with a pawn structure similar to the game.

{{< standalone-notation >}}7...Ng4 8. Nxh7 Nxh2{{< /standalone-notation >}}

{{< svg-diagram src="/images/diagrams/190827-diag-1.svg" alt="(Position after 8...Nxh2)" fen="rnb1kb2/pppp4/6p1/4pp2/8/4PP2/PPPP2P1/RNB1KB2 w Qq - 0 9" >}}

Black has equalised. Material is even in a quiet position, and black enjoys slightly more space than white.

{{< standalone-notation >}}9. c3?!{{< /standalone-notation >}}

This move doesn't achieve anything useful. It blocks Nc3 and doesn't open up useful diagonals for white here. Claiming space with 9. d4 d5 10. e4 f4 looks more logical, and while black has more space, white should not be too much worse.

{{< standalone-notation >}}9...d5 10. d4 Bh6!{{< /standalone-notation >}}

Black starts to slowly put pressure on white. The text move prevents e4, directly cramping white the most. Now 11. f4 e4 would see black have a space advantage while white's bishops remain slightly cramped.

{{< standalone-notation >}}11. Na3 b5 12. g4 fxg4!{{< /standalone-notation >}}

Preventing g5, which would free white to follow up with e4.

{{< standalone-notation >}}13. Bh3 Bg4 14. Kf1!?{{< /standalone-notation >}}

{{< svg-diagram src="/images/diagrams/190827-diag-2.svg" alt="(Position after 14. Kf1)" fen="rn2k3/p1p5/6pb/1p1pp3/3P2b1/N1P1PP1B/PP6/R1B2K2 b q - 3 14" >}}

White is feeling the pressure, and feels compelled to go for this plan, unpinning the e-pawn and playing e4, meeting ...Bd2 with Bxd2. It does however leave white's king rather dangerously placed on the kingside, with the f- and h-files both vulnerable. Black has a natural plan of ...Nd7, ...0-0-0 and trying to invade with the rook. White's main concern is neutralising that plan, either by counterattacking on the queenside with moves like 14. Nc2 and b4, or trying to develop the a1 rook with the text move - or perhaps even with 14. e4!? Bd2+ 15. Kf1, arguing that freeing the queenside is worth more than having a displaced king.

{{< standalone-notation >}}14...Nd7 15. e4 Bd2 16. Bxd2 0-0-0 17. f4 Rf8!{{< /standalone-notation >}}

{{< svg-diagram src="/images/diagrams/190827-diag-3.svg" alt="(Position after 17...Rf8)" fen="2k2r2/p1pn4/6p1/1p1pp3/3PPPb1/N1P4B/PP6/R4K2 w - - 1 18" >}}

Playing 17. f4 is tricky, increasing the tension. White's other logical try would be 17. Rc1, with the dual plans of counterattacking with c4 or the defensive rook lift Rc2.
